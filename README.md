#### Members:

- Matheus Santos Melo

#### Partner:
- City of St. Gallen ([Info](https://www.stadt.sg.ch/home/welcome.html))

#### Goals:
- increase the overall paybacks and 
therefore reduce overall costs,
- without increasing individual fallbacks 
into the social aid system
- based on a data analysis of the 
current and former recipients

#### Specific Questions:
- The Social Service department has a specific need and will try to evaluate, test and 
implement your solutions afterwards.
- They act as a client of yours and therefore asks you the following specific questions:
    - Which groups of recipients do they need to motivate in order to increase overall paybacks without 
jeopardizing their financial well-being and optimize the departmentâ€™s scarce personal resources?
    - What motivational options exist to support recipients
    - How can these measures be communicated / transported to the recipients?

#### Our solution (summary)
We started by analyzing the data using an AI and we have found that some topics are more importance than others in order to have a return of money
Then we thought about how to increase the return and we came up with an idea of an application that might be useful for the people that are using the social services and the city of St. Gallen to reduce costs, increase returns and collect more data.
In our application the user can easily control how he spends the money, how far away his goal is. The application will calculate the motivation of the user based on different criteria and give feedback.
In the application there will also be a section with the community. All the people are anonymous but they can share stories, ask for information and spread hints to others.
We believe that this helps people to exit social service earlier and once out the feeling of community, that exists other people that are in the same situation, will more likely increase the chance that they will pay back (to reuse the money to help others)
Under the folder "Images" there are some graphics examples on how the application will look like.
