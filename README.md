#### Goals:
- increase the overall paybacks and 
therefore reduce overall costs,
- without increasing individual fallbacks 
into the social aid system
- based on a data analysis of the 
current and former recipients

#### Specific Questions:
- The Social Service department has a specific need and will try to evaluate, test and 
implement your solutions afterwards.
- They act as a client of yours and therefore asks you the following specific questions:
    - Which groups of recipients do they need to motivate in order to increase overall paybacks without 
jeopardizing their financial well-being and optimize the departmentâ€™s scarce personal resources?
    - What motivational options exist to support recipients
    - How can these measures be communicated / transported to the recipients?
